# Linux2
Main Objective:
Read the contents of the other file in this directory to get the flag!

Optional Objective:
There is a second folder (Secrets) that contains fragments of the flag. See if you can piece the flag together.
    (Hint) Try utilizing a wildcard character to interact with all of the files in the present directory at the same time!
    /root/Linux2/Secrets/*
    (Another hint) See if there's a way for you to delete the newline character from standard output!

As always, reach out to instructors if you need any assistance :)
